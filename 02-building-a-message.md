# Building a message

First, we'll need to install the libraries we'll use. In the terminal, run:

`pip install slackclient`

Then, I'll need to add your app to the #slack-bots channel, so put the name of your app in that channel.

Finally, you should be able to run our Python script to test things out:

`python slack_bot.py`
